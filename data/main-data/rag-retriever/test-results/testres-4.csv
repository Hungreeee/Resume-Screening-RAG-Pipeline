Why Cisco:
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think were old (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but were also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do you cant put us in a box!
But Digital Transformation is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think were old (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but were also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do you cant put us in a box!
But Digital Transformation is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Dont care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? Thats cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"," ():

Full Stack Web Developer

With over 7 years of experience in web development, I am confident that I am the perfect candidate for the Full Stack Developer position at MHSI. My passion for programming and learning new technologies has motivated me to develop a strong skillset in PHP-based MVC frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony. I have extensive experience in creating and maintaining web and mobile applications, with solid skills in HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, and Javascript/jQuery development. 

In my previous role, I led a team of developers for a project using Laravel framework, where I successfully handled the creation and maintenance of a web-based database system. I have also worked on various projects using SQL Server and T-SQL, and I am familiar with version control tools such as Git and SVN. 

My effective written and oral communication skills, good follow-up and interface skills, and ability to multi-task and switch between multiple projects make me an ideal candidate for this position. I am a self-starter and a motivated problem-solver, always willing to take on new challenges and excel in my work.
